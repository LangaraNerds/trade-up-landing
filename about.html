            <h1>Why Crypto?</h1>
            <p>
              Cryptocurrency is quickly becoming one of the most popular
              investment opportunities in the world. Learning to trade
              cryptocurrency can be intimidating—and it's not always clear how
              to get started. We want to make it simpler for others that's why
              we made TradeUp. You can learn trading skills and practice them on
              our platform whenever you want—it's easy and fun!

              TradeUp is made for people who are looking for a user-friendly
              interface to learn and practice trading. We spent 13 weeks
              developing this app that will help you understand the
              cryptocurrency market and get started trading.

              We knew that the planning and preparation process was going to be
              incredibly important. To make sure we stayed on top of things, we
              scheduled weekly meetings to communicate our thoughts and ideas.
              We went through every possible scenario and made sure we had a
              solution ready. We planned and designed everything with precision.
              We made sure that everyone was on the same page with planning
              documents shared and discussed amongst every team member.

              In addition to the standard UX work, the designers on the team
              played a vital role in designing wireframes, mockups, a UI kit, a
              Logo, promotional material, and even the app icon. The designers
              went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that everything
              was perfect before handing it off to the developers.
            </p>

              The developers did an amazing job with the front-end and back-end
              coding of this app. The user interface is sleek and modern, and it
              required a lot of coding to assure the app was fully functional
              for all devices. The developers used APIs to provide real-time
              data, which was essential for making this project successful.
